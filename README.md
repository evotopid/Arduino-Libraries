About
=====

Hi there, here are some helpful Arduino Libraries, which I
created for my own Arduino projects and which I want to share, just for
the case that someone also might use them.

Of course there may be many things to increase, but if you find something
like this just fill out an Issue.

Please note that more doc will come soon.


API Documentation
=================

To create the API documentation you will need to have
[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) installed on your computer.

Then you can run: ```doxygen DOXYFILE``` and your documentation will be created.


Requirements
============

The libraries are currently working with Arduino 1.0.

Newer versions should most probably work with the libraries, but older versions won't
because in the release of Arduino 1.0 some things changed and this backward compatibility
isn't nescesary, as everyone should be able to install the newest version of the
Arduino IDE.


Libraries
=========

Currently there are only two libraries here, but this will change:

* Button: A Library which helps you to manage user interactions with Buttons.
* Output: A Library which helps you to manage your outputs with ease.
