About
=====

Hi there, this repo contains some helpful Arduino Libraries, which I
created because I wanted to develop easier with Arduino.

Of course there may be many things to increase, but if you find something
like this just fill out an Issue.

Please note that more doc will come soon.


API Documentation
=================

To create the API documentation you will need to have
[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) installed on your computer.

Then you can run: ```doxygen DOXYFILE``` and your documentation will be created.


Requirements
============

The libraries are currently working with Arduino 1.0.

Older (and newer) versions would eventually need some modifications to work.


Libraries
=========

Currently there are only two libraries here, but this will change:

* Button: A Library which helps you to manage user interactions with Buttons.
* Output: A Library which helps you to manage your outputs with ease.
