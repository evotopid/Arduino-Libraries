About
=====

Hi there, this repo contains some helpful Arduino Libraries, which I
created because I wanted to develop easier with Arduino.
Of course there may be many things to increase, but if you find something
like this just fill out an Issue.
Please note that some doc will come soon.

Libraries
=========

Currently there is only one library here, but this will change:

* Button: A Library which helps you to manage user interactions with Buttons.
